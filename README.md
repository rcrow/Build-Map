# Build-Map
Written by Ryan Crow

When creating geologic maps we typically build polygons from lines (contacts and faults) and attribute them with label points. This approach has certain advantages (and disadvantages) as polygons never need to be edited; they are just rebuilt. This tool (Build and Symbolize) automates the steps needed to do that rebuilding and resymbolizing. A disadvantage of this approach is that 
multiple or no label points can be associated with a given polygon. This tool (Build and Check) also identifies these polygons, which have too many or not enough label points. 

A separate toolbox, Check Unique, checks for multiple label points that are not identical. This tool needs to be better documented ...
